# Implementation Plan: Baseline k3s Ansible Cluster Lifecycle

**Branch**: `001-k3s-ansible-baseline` | **Date**: 2026-02-16 | **Spec**: [specs/001-k3s-ansible-baseline/spec.md](specs/001-k3s-ansible-baseline/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-k3s-ansible-baseline/spec.md`

**Note**: This plan is filled by the `/speckit.plan` workflow for the k3s cluster lifecycle Ansible playbook.

## Summary

Implement a set of Ansible playbooks and roles that manage the complete lifecycle of a k3s cluster: provisioning a new HA cluster (embedded etcd, control-plane behind a VIP/load balancer), updating configuration for existing clusters, and adding/removing control-plane and worker nodes. One core playbook provisions and updates the k3s cluster itself, while a separate add-ons playbook installs and manages optional platform components (cert-manager with provider-agnostic DNS-01 issuers, multus for VLAN-based pod networking, Rancher and rancher-monitoring, Traefik, and optional Synology CSI-backed storage) that can be enabled or disabled via variables. All playbooks remain idempotent, k3s-specific, and driven entirely from inventory and variables.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Ansible playbooks (YAML); minimum supported Ansible Core version 2.15+
**Primary Dependencies**: Ansible, k3s, k3s-io/k3s-ansible collection, cert-manager, multus CNI, Rancher and rancher-monitoring stack, Traefik ingress, kube-vip (or equivalent LB/VIP mechanism), optional Synology CSI driver
**Storage**: Embedded etcd for k3s control-plane state; optional Synology CSI-backed persistent volumes for workloads
**Testing**: ansible-lint and `ansible-playbook --check` as the mandatory baseline; Molecule-based role tests are potential follow-up work, not required for this feature
**Target Platform**: Linux servers (e.g., Debian/Ubuntu family, systemd-based, x86_64/arm64) reachable via SSH, as per constitution
**Project Type**: Single infra automation project (Ansible playbooks and roles, no separate frontend/backend applications)
**Performance Goals**: No strict numeric SLOs for this baseline; design targets correctness and idempotence for small-to-medium HA clusters, with provisioning time primarily constrained by environment
**Constraints**: Idempotent runs; safe minor/patch k3s upgrades only; k3s-specific behavior (no kubeadm assumptions); no explicit hard limit on maximum cluster size in this feature
**Scale/Scope**: Reference examples will target 1–3 control-plane nodes and a handful of workers (for example, up to ~10), while keeping the design structurally capable of larger clusters without guaranteeing behavior at very large scale

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Gate C1 – Minimal, Focused Playbooks**: Scope is limited to the k3s cluster lifecycle as the core concern, with platform add-ons (networking, ingress, certificates, monitoring, optional storage) provided via a separate add-ons playbook and conditional variables so that the core cluster can be provisioned independently. No application workloads are included. **Status: PASS (confirmed after Phase 1 design)**.
- **Gate C2 – Idempotent Cluster Provisioning**: Roles are planned to be idempotent and safe to re-run (modules over raw shell, guarded destructive actions, safe upgrades), with lint/check-mode and smoke tests supporting this. **Status: PASS (design and validation approach defined)**.
- **Gate C3 – k3s-Specific Constraints (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: Design pins k3s version via variables, uses embedded etcd HA, and explicitly scopes out major version upgrades. **Status: PASS**.
- **Gate C4 – Clear Inventory and Node Roles**: Inventory and data model define explicit groups (`k3s_servers`, `k3s_agents`) and host vars for labels/taints, with no hard-coded hosts. **Status: PASS**.
- **Gate C5 – Security, Networking, and Upgrades**: Networking and VIP/load-balancer patterns (kube-vip) are modeled in the data model and contracts; only controlled minor/patch upgrades are supported as per clarification. **Status: PASS**.

No constitution violations are currently anticipated after Phase 1; Complexity Tracking remains empty.

```

**Structure Decision**: Use a single Ansible-focused project rooted under `ansible/` with standard inventories, group/host vars, and roles dedicated to each platform component (k3s core, cert-manager, multus, Rancher stack, Traefik, Synology CSI). Playbooks under `ansible/playbooks/` map directly to the primary user workflows (provision/update cluster, scale nodes, perform minor/patch upgrades). A lightweight `tests/ansible/` tree will host inventories and smoke tests rather than a separate service/application codebase.
